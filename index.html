I still remember when we first met through Instagram. Honestly, I never thought youâ€™d become my best friend.  
At the start, I didnâ€™t feel itâ€”but even before meeting you in person, my perspective completely changed.  

Thank you so much for always being there for me. When Iâ€™ve been crying or venting, and no one else stayed, you listened.  
You truly listened. It would have been so hard without you in those moments, and that means more to me than I can put into words.  
Even when it might have been boring or tiring for you, you never gave up on me.  

I feel so safe when Iâ€™m around you â€” and thatâ€™s something really special to me. Even though youâ€™re a male friend,  
being with you feels comforting and reassuring, like nothing can go wrong.  
Iâ€™ll never forget the day we met in person. We had so much fun, and just being there with you felt so good.  
I hope we get to have moments like that for our entire lives.  

Going to the PVP, laughing, talking, just enjoying the day â€” those are some of my favorite memories.  
The care and support youâ€™ve shown me are truly golden. Youâ€™re not just a friend; youâ€™re a person I can always rely on,  
and thatâ€™s rare and precious.  

Thank you for being my true friend, Samuel Manohar. Iâ€™m so lucky to have you in my life.  
I hope your birthday is as amazing as you are, and I hope we continue making unforgettable memories together.`;
